🕒 Aesthetic Dual-Mode Pomodoro Timer

by lavish lohiya

🎯 Overview

This project is my CS50x Final Project, a modern and aesthetic Pomodoro timer web app built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no backend, and zero cost to run.

It helps users focus and manage their study or work sessions effectively using the Pomodoro Technique, where focused work intervals alternate with short and long breaks.

The app runs fully offline and remembers your theme and task list using your browser’s local storage.

✨ Features

✅ Dual Theme Mode:
Switch between Black + Gold (luxury aesthetic) and Red + Black (power/focus) modes.

✅ Pomodoro Timer:
Modes include Pomodoro (25 min), Short Break (5 min), and Long Break (15 min).

✅ Tick Sound:
Real-time ticking sound every second (toggleable).

✅ Task Manager:
Add, check, and delete tasks — all saved locally so they persist between sessions.

✅ Aesthetic UI:
Modern circular timer design with smooth animations, shadows, and glowing accents.

✅ Offline-First:
No server or database — everything runs in your browser.

🧠 Technologies Used

* HTML5 — structure

* CSS3 — custom aesthetic design

* JavaScript (ES6) — logic and interactivity

* LocalStorage API — persistent data

🛠 How It Works

When you open the page, you can:

1. Choose between Pomodoro, Short Break, or Long Break.

2. Start the timer — each second triggers a tick sound.

3. Add or complete tasks as you study.

4. Switch between Gold and Red themes anytime.

5. All progress, tasks, and settings are stored locally.

The app uses one HTML file for simplicity, keeping JavaScript inside <script> and CSS inside <style> tags for ease of deployment.

🌐 Deployment

The app is hosted for free on GitHub Pages at:

💬 Reflection

I created this project to combine aesthetic design and productivity using just core web technologies.
I learned how to:

* Implement timers and intervals precisely in JavaScript.

* Manage app state locally without a backend.

* Design dark-and-light UI themes that stay readable and elegant.

* Use GitHub Pages for free hosting and deployment.

This project helped me understand how simple web tools can be used to build complete, beautiful, and functional applications.
